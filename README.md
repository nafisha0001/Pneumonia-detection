# Pneumonia Detection from X-ray Images

This project aims to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia using various machine learning and deep learning models. After evaluating multiple models, DenseNet121 was found to provide the best performance.

## Models Tested
The following models were implemented and compared:

### Traditional Machine Learning Models:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* SVM
* K-Means Clustering
* DBScan

### Deep Learning Models:

Simple CNN
* ResNet
* VGG
* MobileNet
* Inception
* DenseNet121
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting

## Results & Findings
Among all models, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy and generalization capability. It performed well due to its feature reuse mechanism and deep architecture.
